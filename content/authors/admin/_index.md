I work as a research assistent in [Institute for Language, Cognition and Computation](https://web.inf.ed.ac.uk/ilcc), covering topics on the information extraction. I pursued my post-graduate studies at [University of Edinburgh](https://www.ed.ac.uk/) with specific interest in natual language processing. My dissertation project was supervised by Prof [Jeff Z. Pan](https://knowledge-representation.org/j.z.pan/). Prior to my study, I received the First Class Honor of my bachelor’s degree from [University of Nottingham](https://www.nottingham.ac.uk/), major in Mathematics with Applied Mathematics.

**I am actively looking for a fully-funded PhD position starting in the fall of 2024, primarily in the area of knowledgable and trustworthy Large Language Models. Please feel free to contact me for any possible opportunities!**
